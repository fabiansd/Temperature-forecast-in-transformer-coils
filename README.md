# Temperature-forecast-in-transformer-coils

In this project an RNN is trained on sequences of sensor measurements and outputs a forecast on the temperature development in the coils of an electric transformer. This project is meant as a proof of concept on the possibilites behind health monitoring and predictive maintenance in the industry.
